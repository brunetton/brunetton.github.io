So, I [like to play piano](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6QzQYkVJ_gCRKN_n9gUps8BbYDHkGJ49). And I like to play [random pianos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g0CSrB_2PQ) when they come across my road.

There are plenty of pianos around, mainly in big cities (librairies, cafes, restaurants, shopping centers ...); and on French train stations. But those pianos are not always simple to find, so I created a map based on OpenStreetMap to find them quickly:

Now there are plenty of contribution all other the world :)
